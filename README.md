# Ash Pedigree Instructions
1. The idea behind the Ash Pedigree is to serve as a symbolic memory of past adventures.  You add them to a meaningful campfire (often at the conclusion), and then collect the ashes the next morning.  These ashes are in turn kept and used at a future date, where the fire from the previous campout will be continued.

2. If you're in a Troop/Pack and do not use the GIT source control system, try to seek someone who has - while it's not complicated, it can be confusing.  The basic idea is to use the ash pedigree like source code from a computer program,  where each "line" (Troop/Pack/individual) is tracked as a branch to facilitate merging should the opportunity arrive.

3. If you attended the 2020 Virtual Campout and recieved ashs from Chris Gray/Pack428, you will see a branch for your Pack/Troop.  If you have received ashes from others, please feel free to create your own branch

4. As you use the ashes in your ceremonies, update your branch with campfires and events. Please limit each event to one row per event

5. Should your Pack/Troop blend ashes with those of others, merge the branches as you would source code.

6. To maintain 'two deep' each commit of campfires/events will require approval,  this is just a formality.
