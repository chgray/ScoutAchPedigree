# Materials
* Campfire, fireplace, or candle
* Something small that is safe to burn to serve as your memory of this event
* Ashes from previous campouts, if you have them readily available (dont drive anywhere to get them :))
* A copy of this document to read


# Instructions (for your home, and how to get mailed a small portion of real ashes)

Before we begin, if anyone has brought ashes they'd like to add to this fire,  please quietly make your way to the front row and wait to be addressed.

Typically this ceremony is performed at the end of a campfire by someone who is in physical possession of the ashes.  The legend goes that in 1907 Baden-Powell hosted a campfire.  During the campfire, each Scout would add something, like a pinecone, to the fire.  This item served as a physical representation of their memory of that day.

In this legond, the Scouts would retrieve the ashes from a ceremonial campfire and spread them into the next campfire. This was done, symbolically, to recall memories of past campfires and to highlight to all Scouts and Scouters the bonds that connect us with our fellow Scouts and Scouters around the world.

The ashes we spread tonight into this campfire carry memories of past campfires dating back to the founding of Scouting in 1907.  They have been carried around the world to well over 1000 Scouting campfires in 50 countries where Scouting fellowship has been shared.

By adding these ashes to our campfire tonight, we symbolically send greetings to our brother and sister Scouts around the world.  And, as these ashes mingle with tonight’s campfire, we join the memories of our own past campfire experiences and those of Scouts that have come before us with tonight’s program. 

This campfire is the 1094'th campfire, on record.  


1. Camp Russell as the world celebrated the end of WWI
2. Throughout the 1930's these ashes were in El Dora Iowa where year over year we'd first hear of the amplifying struggles as the Great Depression begins,  and then of the continued relief and optimism as the Great Depression came to an end.  
3. They remained in continued use within campfires in El Dora Iowa when the US entered WWII in 1941 and remained in Iowa we celebrated the end of the war.  

4. In the late 1980's these ashes were in my old stomping grounds of Tennessee. They were present at several adult training courses, and although coincidentally, likely burned in front of the leaders of both my Pack and Troop. 

5. In May of 2019 they were with my Pack, to celerate the first year where we had a vibrant Girls Den.

6. Interesting during 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these ashes were involved in a virtual campout - where Boys and Girls in both the BSA and the Girl Scouts from all over the world shared a virtual campfire.
	* Several first girls dens / troops
	* Baltimore, Oregon, Maine
	

We will let this campfire conclude naturally tonight, and collect the ashes in the morning.  If you'd like to help carry on this tradtion within your Troop or Pack, Bill will provide information tomorrow on how to get a sample at breakfast tomorrow.

Please keep track of when and where you use the ashes, and bring them with you to major events such as this - 

Before the campfire concludes,  please take a moment of silence to think about those who watched these ashes that burn before you
